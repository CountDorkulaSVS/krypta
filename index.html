          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The Sneaky Vampire Syndicate is an NFT Collection of 8,888 Vampires living their best life in The Lair - away from any burning sunlight or pesky Vampire Hunters. The Syndicate is known for its community, eager to adopt their Sneaky Bats, play the SVS video game, enter The Lair (MetaVerse), and meet Female Vampires (Gen 2). All Vampire holders gain access to join their kin in the MetaVerse, while having access to their very own exclusive video game. 8,888 Vampires are now running wild, with their companions and much more coming soon.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>NFTs or "non-fungible-tokens" are unique, one of one, digital assests that are secured by a blockchain, like Ethereum. NFTs often take form of an image, video, or song, where the holder has full blockchain-proven ownership of the asset. NFTs have created a new medium for artists and collectors to share their pieces.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>			The Team noticed a gap in the NFT space for the Vampires. There was an increase in the amount of creatures/animal projects being created, but saw this as a unique opportunity to bring the Vampires to life! Our extremely talented artist, @migwashere also has a love for movies, which you may see come across in some of our teasers. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>The initial release of the Vampires (Gen1) was on September 12th, 2021 with a Mint price of .08eth. This Mint was accompanied by an NFT world-first process that eliminated Bots & allowed for a fair Minting process for the Community.</p>

            <p>The Vampire (Gen1) Companions, Bats, will be available for Mint (free + gas transaction cost) for every (Gen1) Vampire starting October 21st, 2021 at 1pm EST.</p>
			<p>The claiming period for the bats will be 7 Days, until October 28th, 2021. You have these 7 days to claim, therefore there is no need and no incentive to rush - claim when gas is low. Bats will then be revealed on October 28th, 2021, several hours after the claiming window closes. There is no need to unstake your Vampire to be able to claim. Your Vampire can remain staked and you will still be able to claim.</p>
			<p>*Reminder: If you do not claim by the end of the claiming window on October 28th, 2021, you will FOREVER lose the opportunity to claim your Vampire's (Gen1) companion Bat.*</p>

            <p>Staking is the act of sending your NFT assest to an "NFT Ecosystem" contract that provides safekeeping and governance. In most cases, Staking your asset(s) allows the owner to earn Ecosystem Utility Tokens.</p> <br>
			<p>In the case of the Sneaky Vampire Syndicate, Staking your Vampires & Bats will allow owners to be rewarded with the Ecosystem's Utility Token known as the $BLOOD Token.</p>
			<p>The current staking rate is as follows: (3) $BLOOD Tokens per Vampire (Gen1) for every 24 hours it is Staked. (1) $BLOOD Token per Bat (Gen1) for every 24 hours it is Staked.</p>

			<p>I'm a full-time, almost no days off, nose to the grinder freelance artist and I've been a part of many projects in my life. From books to board games. Video games to  animated films. I've worked as a storyboard artist and a corporate artist for large companies. </p>
			I've burnt out many times in my life long artistic career. It can happen to any artist and some burnouts can lead to loss of inspiration and passion for what was once something that gave great joy. Recently, however, I've been introduced to the wonderous world of the NFT space. And it has since re-ignited a fire in me and opened my eyes to endless possibilities and ideas. I'm very excited to be part of such a motivated and experienced team and I hope everyone enjoys the art I've created.</p>
